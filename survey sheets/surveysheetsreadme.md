# Survey Sheets

This folder contains the survey sheets where the Excel tools are based on. 
The survey sheets have not been updated with the new codings used in the v2.0-beta.0 Excel tools. However, the changes are very few, namely:
1) In all **coded_data**, answers for *others* in rank columns in **communication preferences** have been nominally coded "2" 
2) In the **vet survey sheet**, please **ignore** items **11-16** in the "**Knowledge-related questions**" portion.
