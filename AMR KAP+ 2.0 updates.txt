#AMR-AMU KAP+ Survey Database beta 2.0 ReadME

##Database Architecture

(/desktop/architecture.png)

##Updates

1. Improved spreadsheet design for easy import into SPSS and R.

2. inclusion of raw data sheet, coded data sheet, and processed data sheet for flexibility of analysis

3. changes in input variables

4. new codebook to accomodate text inputs (e.g. medicine names)

5. new codes
	-"na" stands for "no answer", meaning the interviewee cannot answer or does not have an answer. This still counts as data and should not be confused with missing data ("NA")
	-new variable coding:
		[category(d,k,a,p,e,c) + item number]_var name (+ var attribute)
	
6. renaming of existing variables
	- presence of AMR laws -> reach of AMR laws (since laws could exist but are not communicated/enacted well)
	- Involvement in Farming Community -> Participatiin Farming Community (since one can be involved de jure but not participate or participate in a lesser degree)

7) summary! calculates t-test of correct and incorrect ratios in each variable

##Recommendations

1) to prevent QRPs such as data peeking and HARKING, It would be very advisable to collect the data first with a copy of the raw_data sheet first and import the data into the database AFTER ALL of the sample data has been collected
